<p>While the ability to detect the somatic variants in peripheral blood is already transforming cancer care, there is more that we can learn from a single patient sample. A patient's leukocytes can reveal important changes in the immune system and we have developed methods to <b>profile individual T cell receptors</b> (TCRs), found on the surface of T lymphocytes. Below is a graph of the V-J combinations we measured in a healthy individual's TCR &beta;-chains. The thickness of the joining lines represents the number of unique CDR3.</p>
<p>We have developed the ability to count T cell populations through simultaneous sequencing of &alpha;-chain and &beta;-chain CDR3 repertoires, and we can monitor T cell population changes that occur during the course of immuno-therapy treatment.
<p>Roll-over the different V or J regions to isolate the combinations.</p>
