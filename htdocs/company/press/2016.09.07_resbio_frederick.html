<p class="lead"><span class="dateline"> SEATTLE, September 7, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --</span>Resolution Bioscience, Inc. today announced that it has entered into an agreement with the Leidos Biomedical Research Inc, which operates the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, to evaluate Resolution Bio's ctDx&trade; novel chemistry and proprietary bioinformatics data analysis pipeline. The agreement includes training of the Frederick National Laboratory's scientific staff, an effort that is already underway, as well as potential publication of results.
</p>
<p>"We are evaluating liquid biopsy technologies that can be used to detect all forms of actionable mutations from clinical specimens," said Jason Lih, head of the Frederick National Laboratory's Molecular Characterization Lab.</p>
<p>
"We are excited to bring our platform to the Frederick National Laboratory," said Mark Li, CEO, Resolution Bioscience. "The ctDx technology has demonstrated the ability to detect not only hotspot SNVs and small indels, but also gene fusions and copy number alterations.  In order for a liquid biopsy assay to be clinically relevant, we believe it has to be able to see all types of alterations that drive an individual's cancer, from a single patient sample, in a relevant turnaround time."
</p><p>
The ctDx platform was designed to be a distributable kit in order to move the technology as close to the patient as possible.  Shipping specimens to a central lab adds unnecessary time to return actionable results to clinicians and patients, not to mention the potential for sample loss.  A fast turnaround time, measured in days, not weeks, is one of the major benefits of the technology. The Frederick National Laboratory, sponsored by the National Cancer Institute, is the first group that Resolution Bio is enabling with its ctDx liquid biopsy platform. The company is in discussions to enable select CROs, reference labs, and research institutions worldwide to access this technology.
</p><p>
Resolution Bioscience's (Bellevue, WA) best-in-class cfDNA platform was the first to demonstrate comprehensive detection of all somatic mutation types in blood, including point mutations, indels, copy number changes and fusions down to 0.1% allelic frequency.  The robust platform allows simultaneous de-novo discovery of novel fusion events and detection of canonical fusions. The company develops custom cfDNA assays to support clinical use and companion diagnostics. The ctDx platform is developed under design control. The company's mission is to transform cancer outcomes by providing noninvasive diagnostic tools to guide the development and clinical implementation of personalized treatment strategies.
