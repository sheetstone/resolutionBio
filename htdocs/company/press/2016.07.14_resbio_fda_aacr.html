Resolution Bioscience is pleased to announce its participation in the upcoming <a class='linkOnClick' data-include='300298535' href="http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/NewsEvents/WorkshopsConferences/ucm494610.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">FDA-AACR&#160;Liquid Biopsies in Oncology Drug and Device Development Workshop</a> on <span class="xn-chron">July 19</span><sup>th</sup>, 2016.&#160;&#160; The purpose of this workshop is to provide a forum for the discussion of relevant scientific advances in the field of liquid biopsies and of the regulatory environment that will support the translation of this emerging technology into improved patient care. The analysis of tumor-derived cell-free DNA (cfDNA)&#160;in plasma, a noninvasive method for detecting genetic alterations in tumors, holds considerable promise both for improving cancer diagnoses and monitoring and in drug development.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Tera Eerkes, VP of Strategy and Clinical Operations, will present during the day's third Session, "Liquid Biopsy Test Development" and participate in the following panel discussion.&#160; Topics will include the analytical performance of new diagnostics, use of contrived specimens for controls and performance testing, and tissue-to-plasma concordance.

"We are enthused by the efforts of the FDA and AACR to seek input on the critical and unresolved questions of assessment and regulation of novel precision medicine technologies like Resolution Bioscience's ctDx&#8482; platform," said Dr. Eerkes.&#160; "As a leading NGS technology development company, we value the opportunity to include our expertise in the evolving conversation."
</p><p>
The company develops custom cfDNA gene panels for pharmaceutical companies and research partners. The ctDx platform is currently being developed into a distributable kit, enabling access to this leading technology for CROs, reference labs, and research institutions. The ctDx platform was the first to demonstrate de novo fusion detection in cfDNA and is also able to detect SNVs, indels, and copy number alterations. Recent data was presented at ASCO, highlighting the ability to detect ALK fusions and resistance mutations in a longitudinal manner.
</p><p>
Resolution Bioscience (Bellevue, WA) was founded in 2012 by leading experts in next generation sequencing, genomic analysis and commercial product development. &#160;The company's mission is to transform cancer outcomes by providing physicians and pharmaceutical companies with clinic-ready, noninvasive diagnostic tools to guide the development and clinical implementation of personalized treatment strategies.
