					<h3>Mark Li</h3>
<h4>President and CEO</h4>
<p style="margin-top: 0">
Mark is a serial entrepreneur. Beginning at Ziff-Davis, he pioneered early desktop publishing in books, magazines, and multimedia. He then was part of a two-person team which founded Yahoo! Europe and was responsible for starting and overseeing engineering for regional Yahoo!s in 23 countries and languages. Mark grew up in a household where medicine was a focal point: his father was a surgeon, his mother was a nurse, and his grandfather, Choh Hao Li, was a renowned biochemist who discovered and synthesized human growth hormone. Dinner table conversations drove home the critical need for improving medical technologies and connecting them directly to patient outcomes. Mark is committed to fulfilling that goal at Resolution.<br>

<h3>Lee P. Lim, PhD</h3>
<h4>Chief Scientific Officer and Co-founder</h4>
<p style="margin-top: 0">
Lee is an expert at deciphering the complex biology behind nucleic acid sequences. His work has led to fundamental discoveries in RNA biology including important contributions to the miRNA field. At Merck Research Laboratories, he initiated the use of tissue-specific miRNAs as plasma biomarkers, discovered a miRNA component of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway, developed miRNA mimics for anti-cancer therapeutic applications, and uncovered widespread miRNA targeting of transcripts. Lee studied DNA repair as an undergraduate in the laboratory of Phil Hanawalt at Stanford. He did his graduate work on RNA splicing in the laboratory of Phil Sharp at MIT, and postdoctoral work in miRNA bioinformatics in the MIT labs of David Bartel and Chris Burge. His work has been featured in top scientific journals such as Nature, Cell and Science. He is a recipient of the AAAS Newcomb Cleveland Prize.</p>
