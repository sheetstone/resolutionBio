<p>We can develop custom liquid-biopsy panels for patient enrollment in your clinical trials as an IDE. After initial enrollment, the assay is an excellent development tool, allowing for real-time monitoring of therapy effectiveness and response due to dosage adjustments. During phase II/III, we can work with you to bring to market a non-invasive companion diagnostic (CDx). 
                </p>
<p>Your assay will be developed under <u>rigorous design control</u>.</p>
                <p>Validation usually includes designing the target capture probes and analyzing healthy donor plasma and cell-line admixtures to ensure coverage and sensitivity. Because every request is unique, we work with you to ensure that we meet your research or clinical goals.</p> 
		<p>The ctDx platform was designed from day one to be <u>a distributed IVD kit</u>. In order to help the most patients, a medical technology should be as close to the patient as possible. Shipping samples to a central lab is a waste of precious time and allows for samples to be lost or damaged during transit.</p>
