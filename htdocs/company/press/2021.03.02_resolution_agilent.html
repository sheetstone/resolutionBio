<p class="lead"><span class="dateline">KIRKLAND, Washington &mdash; March 2, 2021</span> &mdash; 
<a href="http://www.agilent.com/">Agilent Technologies</a>, Inc. (NYSE: A), today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Resolution Bioscience Inc., a leader in the development and commercialization of next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based precision oncology solutions. The acquisition complements and expands Agilent’s capabilities in NGS-based cancer diagnostics and provides the company with innovative technology to further serve the needs of the fast-growing precision medicine market. Under the terms of the agreement, Agilent will pay $550 million in cash at closing and up to an additional $145 million based on achieving future performance milestones.
<p>
Resolution Bioscience’s non-invasive liquid biopsy assay platform supports both the biopharma services market and the clinical oncology diagnostic testing market and is enabled by its Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified lab. The platform has been designed for both a centralized CLIA test service and a distributable kit format. In addition, the Resolution Bioscience homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) assay has received Breakthrough Device Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The assay is performed on a standard blood sample and detects actionable mutations in genes for identifying cancer. Last year, Resolution Bioscience announced a commercial partnership with LabCorp to enable broad access to the Resolution ctDx Lung&trade; test that detects actionable mutations in genes associated with non-small cell lung cancer. 
</p>
<p>
&quot;We are extremely pleased to add Resolution Bioscience’s outstanding team and powerful technology to Agilent’s growing business in precision oncology solutions,&quot; said Mike McMullen, Agilent President and CEO. &quot;By adding Resolution Bioscience’s liquid biopsy-based diagnostic technologies to our portfolio, we are strengthening our offering to our biopharma customers and boosting the growth of our diagnostics and genomics business. This also accelerates our strategy to broaden access to precision oncology testing for patients worldwide through distributed NGS-based diagnostic kits. We look forward to Resolution Bioscience joining with us to expand our work in the fight against cancer together.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Agilent’s broad expertise, global regulatory and commercial infrastructure, extensive partnerships with biopharma companies, and decades-long leadership in precision medicine will enhance and accelerate our groundbreaking work,&quot; said Mark Li, President and CEO of Resolution Bioscience. &quot;We are excited to further expand the use of NGS in precision oncology for clinical diagnostics as part of the Agilent team.&quot;
</p>
