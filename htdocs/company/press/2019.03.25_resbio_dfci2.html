<p class="lead"><span class="dateline">ATLANTA, April 1, 2019</span> — Resolution Bioscience, Inc. today announced that scientists from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute are presenting the results of a retrospective liquid biopsy comparison study between Resolution’s ctDx-Lung assay and Guardant Health’s Guardant360&reg; test this morning at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting. 
</p>
<p> 
Liquid biopsy assays have the potential to expand access to personalized care for those whose tissue biopsies are inadequate or unavailable and may present an opportunity for enhanced cancer monitoring and detection of minimal residual disease. The study was conducted to explore the technical differences and test the reliability of cell-free DNA next-generation sequencing (NGS) assays, which are not completely characterized at this time.

The comparison study highlights detection challenges of complex mutations such as gene fusions, as well as the need for platform cross-comparisons to realize the potential of liquid biopsy and increase access to personalized cancer care. A cohort of 169 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with Guardant360 results were screened for gene fusions. The team of scientists at Dana-Farber used a soon-to-be-released ctDx-Lung kit to analyze 16 cases that had a rearrangement in their tumor, along with additional banked plasma. All personnel involved in sample analysis were blinded to tumor genotype and Guardant360 results. The team found that the Resolution ctDx-Lung assay identified more actionable gene fusion mutations with higher allele frequencies than the Guardant360 test. The results further demonstrate the potential of the ctDx-Lung kit for patients with advanced NSCLC. 
</p><p> 
The ctDx-lung kit detected 13 out 16 fusions (allele frequency range 80-0.3%), while Guardant360 detected only seven (allele frequency range 10-0.3%). Of the 13 cases where an oncogenic fusion was detected in plasma, 89% of patients with productive fusions and 75% of patients with ‘non-productive’ fusions responded to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapies. Additional unblinding is ongoing to better understand false negative cases.

“This study is another strong validation of our targeted NGS-based liquid biopsy platform and its ability to outperform other assays, such as the Guardant360 test,” said Mark Li, CEO of Resolution Bioscience. “These results prove our kits can be run at the leading cancer centers around the world, enabling more scientists to detect more of these actionable mutations, which will soon transform the way we diagnose, treat and monitor devastating diseases like NSCLC.”
