<p class="lead"><span class="dateline">Kirkland, WA</span>
Resolution Bioscience, Inc. today announced that scientists from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute will be presenting the results of a liquid biopsy comparison study between Resolution’s ctDx-Lung assay and Guardant Health’s Guardant360&reg; at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting on March 29-April 3, 2019. 
</p><p>
The comparison study highlights detection challenges of complex mutations such as gene fusions, as well as the need for platform cross-comparisons to realize the potential of liquid biopsy and increase access to personalized cancer care. A cohort of 169 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with Guardant360 results were screened for gene fusions. The team of scientists at Dana-Farber used a soon-to-be-released ctDx-Lung kit to analyze 16 cases that had a rearrangement in their tumor, along with additional banked plasma. All personnel involved in sample analysis were blinded to tumor genotype and Guardant360 results. The team found that the Resolution ctDx-Lung assay identified more actionable gene fusion mutations with higher allele frequencies than the Guardant360 test. The results further demonstrate the potential of the ctDx-Lung kit for patients with advanced NSCLC.
