<p class="lead"><span class="dateline"> Copenhagen, Denmark, October 7 2016</span>
Resolution Bioscience today announced that data generated by the Resolution ctDx&trade; blood-based NGS platform will be presented at the European Society of Medical Oncology 2016 Congress in Copenhagen. Data from a clinical trial, a NSCLC study with the University of Washington, and data from the ensrtinib trial will be presented.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>42756493EDI1001 Clinical Trial Screening</b><br>335 patients from the trial were screened with the Resolution Bioscience ctCDx&trade; assay. The assay comprehensively targets actionable somatic SNVs, indels, fusions and copy number variants in 16 genes implicated in lung and other cancers, using a proprietary, high-efficiency hybrid capture system and NGS sequencing of ctDNA from plasma. Patients had previously been diagnosed with one of ten histologies, including lung, breast, and ovarian cancer. The patient cohort was a clinically relevant sampling, of treatment- na&iuml;ve patients, those on therapy, and those with refractory disease after >=1 therapy course.</li>
<li><b>CC9372 NSCLC Study</b><br>50 patients from the University of Washington were screened with the ctDx-Lung assay.
<li><b>Ensartinib (X-396) Clinical Trial</b><br>Patient samples were retrospectively analyzed to detect ALK fusions and ALK inhibitor resistance mutations.
</ul>
</p>
<p><b>Results</b><br>Average turn-around-time (TAT) was 8.6 calendar days. The ctCDxTM assay detected >435 somatic mutations of all 4 types; SNVs, indels, fusions, and copy number variation. Somatic lesions were detected in 61% of patients. At least 25% of patients demonstrated canonical driver mutations, including KRAS SNVs, EGFR indels, ERBB2 amplifictaions, MET Exon 14 Splice variants, MET amplifications, and EML4-ALK fusions. Resistance mutations such as EGFR T790M were detected in refractory patients. Detection rates of driver mutations in each indication closely mirrored the published detection rates in tumor tissue. At least 8% of patients from the CC9372 study had complications that precluded a tissue biopsy, thus benefiting from access to a blood-based assay.</p>
<p>In the ensartinib trial, overall concordance of ALK-fusions between the ctDx results and previous FISH testing from tissue was 85%. Concordance between the ctDx results and previous tissue NGS was 88%. Two patients that were FISH positive, but plasma NGS negative did not respond to ensartinib. Four ALK TKI na&iuml;ve patients had tissue available for NGS. Concordance was 100% between those patients and the ctDx results. Canonical resistance mutations in the ALK kinase domain were detected by the ctDx assay, including L1196M, G1296A, T1151M, V1194M, G1202R, S1206F, E1154K, D1203N, and C1156Y.

Resolution Bioscience's (Bellevue, WA) best-in-class circulating cfDNA platform was the first to demonstrate comprehensive detection of all somatic mutation types in blood, including point mutations, indels, copy number changes and fusions down to 0.1% allelic frequency.  The robust platform allows simultaneous discovery of de-novo novel fusion events and detection of canonical fusions.   The company develops custom cfDNA assays to support clinical use and companion diagnostics.  The company's mission is to transform cancer outcomes by providing noninvasive diagnostic tools to guide the development and clinical implementation of personalized treatment strategies.
